# Hello-World-2022
I took this class because I already took both classes in grade 10 and 11 so might as well finish the whole thing. There is also a chance programming can come in handy in my future field. As somene intrested in geography and the world I think Google Maps is designed really well. I find intresting how it can display a variety of layers including terrian data, buisnseses, satellite imagery, and of course street view to any supported location the user picks, creating a very good tool to explore the world in depth with if one wishes to. This year it would be intresting to learn how to create an interactive app outside of repl.it
